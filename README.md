# UI
- Theme(two theme greenish blue for environment and red-black for alert) with dark mode(looks cool)
- Splash Screen with logo
- Cards( Like Alert card,Covid 19 card, Recycling card, Pollution Contribution card)
- Covid 19 feature will contain some cool UI with options of dashboard cases,screen test option,detect face mask option,setting option
- In covid 19 setting option will contain notification enabling and send message to contact of your activities.
- Recycling Card will include nearby dustbin(map) for recycles,purpose of recycling page,recyled materials.
- Pollution contribution will contain to do activites and then it will process how much you have contributed in pollution.We can work here in two progress like we can ask people 
  their acitivites or we can ask questions and on basis of that we can make a key how much he contribute then saved that data in firebase
