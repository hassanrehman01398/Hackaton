# Saving the planet #Hack20

We believe the everyone can save the planet either by reducing any spreading diseases or by following steps or by working on a daily routine therefore we,the flutter devs(seems cool),are bringing an solution to save Earth and we all know that this year we faced many things but do we think that was luck?No,I don't think so that was not luck that was the consequences of all that we did.Yeah we were **Failed** to save Earth.

** A big shout out to all developers working bcz we are next to save Earth **
# UI
- Theme(two theme greenish blue for environment and red-black for alert) with dark mode(looks cool)
- Splash Screen with logo
- Cards( Like Alert card,Covid 19 card, Recycling card, Pollution Contribution card)
- Covid 19 feature will contain some cool UI with options of dashboard cases,screen test option,detect face mask option,setting option
- In covid 19 setting option will contain notification enabling and send message to contact of your activities.
- Recycling Card will include nearby dustbin(map) for recycles,purpose of recycling page,recyled materials.
- Pollution contribution will contain to do activites and then it will process how much you have contributed in pollution.We can work here in two progress like we can ask people 
  their acitivites or we can ask questions and on basis of that we can make a key how much he contribute then saved that data in firebase
- For UI help check this https://github.com/abuanwar072/Covid-19-Flutter-UI
- For screen test form https://www.ziauddinhospital.com/corona/
- For covid 19 tracker https://github.com/lucioeduardo/covid19_tracker
- For quiz which will generate result how much that person contributed in pollution daily https://github.com/ykhade/quizapp (Should be key for daily).Graph should be from and 
tracker will be there too.
- Firebase Messaging stuff.
- https://github.com/marchdev-tk/flutter_google_maps/tree/master/example (for map purpose)

- Use a bicycle or public transport for short commutes
- Plant trees
- Invest in solar power and other renewable energy sources
# FrameWork and Techs:
- Flutter
- Firebase
- Tflite
- Api for daily news
- Node Js for questions uploading
- Google Map api
- Data for recycling 
# Links which we followed:
- Facedection model is not ours it is cloned through one repo.
### **WE BELIEVE THAT BY SHOWING PICTURES PEOPLE UNDERSTAND MORE"


# Some Important points:
### Will make this as a plugin(Our Aim)
### Daily notification at night for pollution contribution quiz and tips
### 

# Finally what master branch contains
**Hello everyone we are Team Hectos and our idea for Flutter Hack 20 is 'Enviro Safe' on which we had been working since last three days so that we can find a solution to environmental problems.
Our application contains four core features which we think had recently effected our lives either by polluting the environment or by spreading of different diseases or
by creating this environment unsafe through different acts.
The core features of our application are **
1) Covid 19 preventation,stats,notifying and Face mask detection
2) Pollution contributer
3) Recycle tips and recycle bins nearby
4) Alert others if you are in danger

- The frameworks and technologies we used in this application are
-  1) Flutter
-  2) Firebase
-  3) Nodejs
-  4) Custom Api
-  5) Tflite(facemask model)

- Now come on features
- 1)Covid 19:
This features show stats,preventation methods,diet and other guides to help you keep yourself from the ongoing pandemic. But the most important features in this is "Notifiying people" and "Detection of Facemask".Yeah why 
detection of facemask.The concept behind this was that we can make a plugin where it takes user's image automatically with their consent and then notifies other 
people in his contact list whether they were wearing mask along with locations they've been to.

-  2) Pollution Contributer:
This is a quiz asking module where user will be asked daily at the end of day to answer some questions and then this will generate result about how much that person has contributed 
in pollution.For now, the model is hard coded but we can use this approach to gather the data and use AI model to generate accurate results about their contribution towards the pollution.But as we were lacking time, we
showed some hard coded data. Though, in future we can see ourselves taking this application to local and then to global level.

-  3)Recycle Tips and Recycle Bins nearby:
This application will notify people daily tips about how they do thier part towards the betterment of the environment whether it is to recycle or changing the materials we use in our daily lives. The more important feature we tried to implement is to locate nearby dustbins or recyle points so people can focus more on recycling.

-  4) Alert:
This feature maybe quite different but the concept behind is to respond quickly during the times of crisis. As in our country, we don't have a centralized emergency service like 911, so people often times find it difficult to contact the right emergency service quickly among many distributed services. Through this feature one can notify 
nearby police station,emergency or any humanity based organization for help with just one touch.

Our main focus behind this application is that we can contribute even a bit in creating a save,eco friendly environment so for that we need to believe that this application is one step to achieve that.
