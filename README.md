We believe the everyone can save the planet either by reducing any spreading diseses or by following steps or by working on a daily routine therefor we,the flutter devs(seems cool),are bringing an solution to save Earth and we all know that this year we faced many things but do we think that was luck?No,I don't think so that was not luck that was the consequences of all that we did.Yeah we were **Failed** to save Earth.

** A big shout out to all developers working bcz we are next to save Earth **
# UI
- Theme(two theme greenish blue for environment and red-black for alert) with dark mode(looks cool)
- Splash Screen with logo
- Cards( Like Alert card,Covid 19 card, Recycling card, Pollution Contribution card)
- Covid 19 feature will contain some cool UI with options of dashboard cases,screen test option,detect face mask option,setting option
- In covid 19 setting option will contain notification enabling and send message to contact of your activities.
- Recycling Card will include nearby dustbin(map) for recycles,purpose of recycling page,recyled materials.
- Pollution contribution will contain to do activites and then it will process how much you have contributed in pollution.We can work here in two progress like we can ask people 
  their acitivites or we can ask questions and on basis of that we can make a key how much he contribute then saved that data in firebase

# Finally what master branch contains
Hello everyone here are hectos and we are in Hack20 Flutter presenting our idea 'Enviro Safe' in which we had worked since last three days so that we can serve
this environment by any how.
Our application contains four core features which we think had recently effected our lives either by polluting the environment or by spreading of different diseases or
by creating this environment unsafe through different acts.
The core features of our application are 
- 1) Covid 19 prevention,stats,notifying and Face mask detection
- 2) Pollution contributer
- 3) Recycle tips and recycle bins nearby
- 4) Alert others if you are in danger
The frameworks and technologies we used in this application are
- 1) Flutter
- 2) Firebase
- 3) Nodejs
- 4) Custom Api
- 5) Tflite(facemask model)
Now come on features
- 1)Covid 19:
This features show stats,prevention methods,diet and help but the most important features in this are "Notifiying people" and "Detection of Facemask".Yeah why 
detection of facemask.The concept behind this was that we can make a plugin where it auto takes user image by asking him and then again by asking him and notifying other 
people whether I was wearing mask along with location

- 2) Pollution Contributer:
This is a quiz asking module where user will ask daily in the end of day to answer some questions and this will generate result how much that person contributed 
in pollution.Yeah the model is hard code behind that but we have a approach to use AI model to generate auto and accurate result.Here we were lacking time but
yeah we will take this application to local and then to global level.

- 3)Recycle Tips and Recycle Bins nearby:
This application will notify people daily tips for recycle and yeah it was our approach to locate nearby dustbins so people can focus more on recycling.

- 4) Alert:
This feature is quite new and the concept behind is to save our environment from different crimes especially (harassment).Through this feature one can notify 
nearby police station,emergency or any humanity based organization for help.

Our main focus behind this application is that we can contribute even a bit in creating a save,eco friendly environment so for that we need to believe in that 
approach which our application presents.
Thanks for giving us chance.
